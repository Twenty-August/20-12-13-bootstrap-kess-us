          Conditions will terminate without our notice if you fail to comply with any term of these Terms and
          Conditions. Upon termination, you will stop representing yourself as a registered Member or Client. You must
          delete or destroy any information or content (including all copies) obtained from our Website. Certain
          provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, copyrights, indemnity, trademarks, limitation of
          liability, warranty, and jurisdictional issues will survive the termination of this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p class="term-heading">Indemnification</p>
        <p class="term-detail">
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us and our partners, agents, officers, directors, employees,
          subcontractors, successors, assigns, third-party suppliers of information and documents, attorneys,
          advertisers, product and service providers, and affiliates free from any liability, loss, claim, and expense,
          including reasonable attorney’s fees, related to your violation of this Agreement or use of our Website or
          Services.
        </p>

        <p class="term-heading">Severability and Survival</p>
        <p class="term-detail">
          Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent
          with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. To the extent that any
          Content is in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement, this Agreement will take precedence. Our failure
          to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of such a provision, nor of the right
          to enforce such a provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p class="term-heading">Changes to Our Terms and Conditions</p>
        <p class="term-detail">
          We reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by giving you advance notice of the
          changes by email or in writing. We will also post these changes on our website. These changes will become
          effective 30 days after receipt of the notice. To avoid doubt, no unilateral amendment will retroactively
          change agreed dispute-resolution provisions of these Terms and Conditions, if any, including, for example,
          arbitration provisions for then-pending disputes unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. Your continued
          use of our Website, Services, and Products after any change to these Terms and Conditions and our notifying
          you will constitute your acceptance of such change. If you do not agree with the changes to these Terms and
          Conditions, you can choose to discontinue the use of our Website, Services, and Products.
